# In order for tasks to be produced as "leaves" of the task graph, they must be attached
# as dependencies to the "all" dummy task. Here this handles the all tasks for PRs. If
# a new final "leaf" task is needed, as it as a kind dependency here so that it will be
# produced as part of the final task graph.
